# The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
# One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - 
# Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing 
# to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to 
# from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the 
# Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
# http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# Here are the data for the project:

# The steps below outlines the analysis steps taken to come up with tidy data at the end:
# Step 1: Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# Step 2: Appropriately label the subject, activity and measurements data sets with descriptive variable names.
# Step 3: Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# Step 4: Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# Step 5: From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set 
#         with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
