accTidy.txt CODE BOOK
=====================

This contains the description of the data in accTidy.txt indicating all the variables and summaries calculated


There are 68 variables that describes the average of each of the 66 measurements on the mean and standard deviation from the features vector (features.txt) for each subject and the activity done by the subject.

subject
Identifies the 30 volunteers within the age bracket 19-48 years.  Each person is identified with a number 1-30.  List of values and their meaning below:
	1 - subject or person number 1
	2 - subject or person number 2
	3 - subject or person number 3
	4 - subject or person number 4
	5 - subject or person number 5
	6 - subject or person number 6
	7 - subject or person number 7
	8 - subject or person number 8
	9 - subject or person number 9
	10 - subject or person number 10
	11 - subject or person number 11
	12 - subject or person number 12
	13 - subject or person number 13
	14 - subject or person number 14
	15 - subject or person number 15
	16 - subject or person number 16
	17 - subject or person number 17
	18 - subject or person number 18
	19 - subject or person number 19
	20 - subject or person number 20
	21 - subject or person number 21
	22 - subject or person number 22
	23 - subject or person number 23
	24 - subject or person number 24
	25 - subject or person number 25
	26 - subject or person number 26
	27 - subject or person number 27
	28 - subject or person number 28
	29 - subject or person number 29
	30 - subject or person number 30

activity
Identifies 6 activities performed by the subject during the experiments while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. List of values below (meaning is self explanatory):
	WALKING
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	SITTING
	STANDING
	LAYING

The following lists a subset (66 out of 561) of the features vector as variables including only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (SD) for each measurement (see features.txt).  The features vector are obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain (see features_info for more details).  
	
The value of each mean and SD variable is the summary or calculated mean / average for each of the mean and SD variables grouped by subject and activity.
